level01 
This is a very simple one. Let us have a look at how it goes. Run the binary in gdb Disassemble the given binary.
disas main 
Notice the compare statement 
0x0804808f <+15>:    cmp $0x10f,%eax 
0x08048094 <+20>: je 0x80480dc <YouWin>
-Check out the decimal value for 0x10f, which is 271. Knowing this value gives you the shell!

level02 
In level 02, have a look at the code. 
Goal: Invoke the catcher function somehow to get the shell. Catcher is handle function of SIGFPE signal. 
Technique: Read the manual page of SIGFPE. You will find that it gets invoked during errors in arithmetic operations, like division by zero.
As per code, we canâ€™t perform division by zero. Dividing integer minimum (or lesser number) by -1
would call SIGFPE. Why waiting? Go ahead and get the shell!
